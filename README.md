# E-Commerce Expert Assistant Chatbot

This project implements a modular chatbot system using FastAPI, capable of answering product-related and order-related queries using microservices.

# Sample Questions and Chatbot Responses

## üß™ How to Run in Visual Studio Code

1. **Open Folder**: Launch VSCode and open the `ecomm_chatbot` folder.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run Each Microservice in Separate Terminal Tabs in VSCode**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd order_service
uvicorn main:app --port 8002

# Terminal 2
cd product_service
uvicorn main:app --port 8001

# Terminal 3
cd chat_service
uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

5. **Test Chatbot**
Use REST clients like Thunder Client (VSCode extension), Postman, or CURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What‚Äôs the status of my order?", "customer_id":37077}'
```
## üîç Product Search Microservice (Upgraded with Real RAG)

This service now uses **true Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered by semantic embeddings.

- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from `sentence-transformers`
- **Search engine**: `FAISS` for fast vector similarity lookup
- **Data source**: `Product_Information_Dataset.csv`, using the `title` and `description` columns

### Example usage:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/search/?query=guitar strings"
